        "stack_Next": "The project's core. I use Next.js deployed on **Vercel**, allowing me to go beyond traditional static site limitations. I leverage hybrid rendering (Server Components + Static Generation) and their Edge Network to deliver an instant, secure, and globally scalable website.",
        "stack_React": "The interface library. It allows me to think of the web as reusable LEGO pieces (components). From the navigation bar to the post cards, everything is a modular component managing its own state and logic.",
        "stack_javascript": "The language connecting everything. I use it for both interface logic and interactive simulations (like genetic algorithms) that run directly in your browser.",
        "stack_styled": "CSS on steroids. It allows me to write real CSS styles inside my JavaScript components. It is the key tool managing the theme system (Dark/Light mode) and ensures that one component's styles do not break another's.",
        "stack_i18n": "The internationalization layer. It manages dynamic routing (/es, /en) and optimized JSON dictionary loading compatible with Server Components. It enables this blog to be natively bilingual without sacrificing static performance.",

        "stack_MDX": "Much more than plain text. MDX allows me to write articles in standard Markdown while embedding interactive React components (charts, simulators) directly between paragraphs. This is what makes this blog 'alive' and not just static text.",
        "stack_remark": "The brain behind the text. It is the processor that reads my Markdown files and builds an 'Abstract Syntax Tree' (AST). Basically, it understands the structure of my notes and transforms them into secure HTML.",
        "stack_latex": "The gold standard in academic writing. Thanks to the integration with Remark, I can write complex equations and scientific notation (like $\\Sigma$) directly in Markdown. The system renders them as perfect mathematical vectors, essential for explaining papers and algorithms.",

        "stack_github": "The code repository. It serves as the project's 'source of truth' for version control. Hosting the code here ensures transparency and allows the community to audit, fork, or learn from the source, aligning with Open Science principles.",
        "stack_vercel": "The infrastructure platform. It connects directly to GitHub to build and deploy the site. It provides the Global Edge Network required for high-performance content delivery and supports the dynamic server-side features of Next.js."
